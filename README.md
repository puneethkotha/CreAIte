# CreAIte

**CreAIte** is a Flutter-based AI image generation app that allows users to create AI-driven images through a combination of canvas drawings and text descriptions. This app uses machine learning techniques to analyze both the drawing and the text input to generate a unique image based on user specifications. Additionally, users can access and store all generated images in the built-in gallery. Whether you're a designer, artist, or simply someone who wants to bring their imagination to life, ScribeAI transforms your ideas into AI-generated visuals.



## Features

- **Canvas Drawing**: Users can create a sketch on the canvas as part of the input for image generation.
- **Text Input for Specifications**: Users can describe the drawing or add specific requirements for the AI to consider while generating the image.
- **AI-Powered Image Generation**: Combines drawing and text input to generate high-quality, AI-driven images.
- **Gallery**: Stores all generated images, allowing users to access and review their creations at any time.
